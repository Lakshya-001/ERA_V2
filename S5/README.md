# MNIST Digit Recognition with Machine Learning

Welcome to the MNIST Digit Recognition project! This repository contains code for training a machine learning model to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The project is organized into the following parts:

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a digit recognition model using machine learning techniques. The MNIST dataset, consisting of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), serves as the foundation for training and evaluating the model.

## Contents

- `model.py`: Implementation of the digit recognition model, including architecture, training, and evaluation logic.
- `utils.py`: Utility functions for data loading, preprocessing, and visualization.
- `Session5.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook providing an interactive walkthrough of the project, including experiments and visualizations.
